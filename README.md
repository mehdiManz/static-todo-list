# Static Todo List

## Features

- Task Creation: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by entering task descriptions.
- Task Management: Users can mark tasks as complete or delete them from the list.
- Persistence: The application uses local storage to save and load the user's to-do list, allowing them to access their tasks even after closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Other Dependencies: Bootstrap, etc.
